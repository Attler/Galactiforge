Physical ammo stats are created by the factories that produce them. i.e. shells can be packed with more powder or different explosives.

Energy weapon stats are created by the power systems that supply them. i.e. lasers can be cooled by water, cryoliquid etc, pumping pressures can be
  increased, energy storage and supply can be more advanced.

Thrusters can be cooled by water, cryoliquid to make them faster. Fuel and coolant pumping pressure can ramp up. 

Your ship is like a mini RTS / Factorio clone.

Ships are strong and don't go down easy.

There must be at least one ship core.
